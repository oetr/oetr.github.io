<h1 class="title">The Artist in You</h1>
<p>
There is something inherently cool about dumping paint on a canvas and smashing the shit out it by using a brush.
Through the great power of induction I will make a bold statement: there exist an artist in everyone, because he exists in me!
To make my point, here is a story from my high-school days in Germany, in the arts class.
Every single time when me and my classmates were told to draw or paint something, there were people who could and who couldn't do it.
I was part of the second group, and sincerely believed that I could not do any of that.
Today, I still think that I am a bad painter!
But I don't need to be a good painter to have fun with painting.
</p>



<p>
I discovered the significance of fun once the topic was to do a modern arts kind of painting!
The fun part was to take color and put it on the canvas.
No thinking, no composition, just spreading the colors, smearing them randomly, mixing them with each other, watching them change, watching the whole canvas change from white to something else, gave me a great sip of dopamine and good grades for all my "modern art" works.
At that time, I started making fun of modern art, because it was so easy.
Everyone was amazed with my paintings, while struggling with their own.
And I was finished way faster than everyone else.
One class mate adapting my "style" and ended up with the same results and grades.
</p>

<p>
The painting ended as soon as I finished the high school, and from then on I was busy studying (more or less) computer science and playing computer games.
After bachelors came masters and Internet addiction!
And this is when the creative part died&#x2014;information consumption made me a passive bitch always wanting more of it.
But fear not, the fangs of the mind freeze can be escaped from time to time.
On one such occasion, I used the time to be creative and paint a picture just for fun.
And fun was it lot!
I even put the picture on my wall because it looks so cool (for me!):
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/painting-001.jpg" alt="painting-001.jpg" width="640" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
The second time I tried it, I even made a cute little documentary of the whole process.
It was made by taking many pictures in succession, while painting.
The pictures are then put one after another to make a video.
The background music is "Disposition" by Tool.
I don't like my second picture as much as the first one, and I probably won't hang it on my walls, but the video is kind of cool in its own way.
So it wasn't a complete waste of time!
